Alteryx Challenge #2



Every year whales around the world migrate from their feeding grounds to their breeding grounds. Some species travel an outstanding 12,000 miles round trip!

 

Use the data sets below to analyze migration movements for different whale species.

The file Whale_Migration_Data contains a list of whales whose migration patterns have been tracked from 2001-2003, and the total kilometers each whale swam on each day of their migration.

The file Whale_Pods contains a list of whale ids and pod ids, which indicates the pod each whale belongs to.

The file Whale_Species contains information about the whale species of each pod.

 

Find the total number of kilometers each pod swam for migration for each year, then find the average number of kilometers each whale in that pod swam (total kilometers / number of whales in the pod). Then, find the pod with the highest average kilometers swam per whale for each species for each year.
